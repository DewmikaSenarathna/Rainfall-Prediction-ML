## 🔬 Machine Learning Approach

Historical rainfall dataset is collected and preprocessed  

Features are normalized and cleaned  

Dataset is split into training and validation sets  

Multiple ML models are trained:  

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Naive Bayes  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- XGBoost  

Models are evaluated using:  

- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report  
- ROC-AUC Score
